# Overview
This is a ECG/SPO2 Monitor Project. We mainly used TI's (Texas Instrument) [ADS1293](http://www.ti.com/product/ads1293)/[AFE4400](http://www.ti.com/product/AFE4400/description) analog front-end IC to acquire physiology data form human body, and used TI's [MSP430F149 MCU](http://www.ti.com/product/MSP430F149/description) to control these Chips, and send the data to our Android Smartphone App via TI's Bluetooth IC [CC2540](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2540/description). In our smartphone App, we can display ECG/PPG wavefore, compute & display SPO2,Heart Rate, and Heart Rate Variability(HRV), and control the hardware to running on different acquision mode (such as 3-Leads or 5-Leads mode).

To do so, we disigned and made a custome PCB using Autodesk EAGLE, did embedded system programing for MSP430 using IAR IDE, and some stuff about smartphone APP. We also had a 3D printed case for our circuit.

The major advantages of our system, is our outstanding power consumption performance. Our hardware only took about 300mW Power for Li-ion battery (about ~180mW for bluetooth). Also, our PCB is super portable, size less than 10-by-10cm.

We Shared the majority of our code and design files. Including MSP430 program, PCB layout, 3D printing models, and some APP code.

We do these stuff is for a [National BME(Biomedical Engineering) Competition for College Students](http://bmedesign.medmeeting.org/cn) in ShenZhen, China.

__On Aug 28, 2018: We just won the FIRST PRIZE in [National BME(Biomedical Engineering) Competition for College Students](http://bmedesign.medmeeting.org/cn) in ShenZhen, China. Which is the HIGHEST AWARD.__

__Fig 2 The PCB layout of ECG/SPO2 Monitor Hardware__

We had a MainBoard, which contains mainly 5 modules, which is 
+ LDO Module for power supply; 
+ ADS Module for ECG; 
+ AFE Module for SPO2; 
+ MCU Module for controlling ;
+ Debugging module, for downloading program(BSL), Serial-USB conversion for a convenient debuging on PC using Processing IDE.

## Power Tree

We used 4.8V Li-ion Battery or 5V USB to powering the whole system. 5V/4.8V is directly feed to USB chip CH340, and the Bluetooth Module. A TI LM1117 LDO chip proveide 3.3V power to ADS1293 ECG Module, and MSP430 MCU Module.

__Fig 4 The Power Tree of our MainPCB__

Powering AFE4400 is a little bit more complicated, to give AFE4400 IC a much more stable voltage supply, we used a Ultra-Low-Noise, High-PSRR [TI TPS7A49](http://www.ti.com/product/TPS7A49/description) chip to provide 3V power for the AFE4400's digital supply (DIG SUP) pins. Then, we used a Low Noise 'Ceramic Stable' LDO [TI LP3878](http://www.ti.com/product/LP3878-ADJ/samplebuy) to provide 3.7v power for AFE4400 LED drive power supply pins (LED DRV). Using two chips, provided us a better isolation in AFE4400, which could minimize the voltage fluctuation interfere from ADS, MCU or AFE LED DRV parts.

## Connectors

For a common use, we choosed standard connectors and cables in our hardware design.

__Fig 5 Hardware Connectors__

For example, for ECG, we used Mindray Standard 6-Pins, 5-Leads ECG cables and connectors; For SPO2, we used the standrad DB9 SPO2 Probe connector. So, it will be easy for our users to find new replcement when old probe is damaged.

## Signal Flow in our PCB

__Fig 6 Signal Flow in our PCB__

In our hardware, we used MSP430 MCU to drive the SPI Bus (as a master device) to configrate ECG and SPO2 Chips (Write data on specific address), and read digital data form each chip.

The MSP430 MCU then compress, encode the sampled data to a long int, and send to the Bluetooth module (To smartphone APP) or a serial-USB debug module via UART.

MSP430 MCU also controled several indicator LED, which we could visulize the sampling rhythm (By flashing of the ADS/AFE LED). LEDs can also provided alarms such as ECG Lead off, SPO2 Cable off for us.
